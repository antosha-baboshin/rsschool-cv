#### About myself:
For the last 3 years I have been working at MTS Belarus (network provider). In 2018, I started working as a consultant in the MTS online store. A year later, I moved to the position of customer service specialist. But the title of the position doesn't reflect the range of my responsibilities.  
Currently, I am promoting the online store: 
* contextual advertising; 
* SMM; 
* banner advertising; 
* offline advertising.  
Also, my responsibilities include keeping and analyzing statistics of the online store, interaction with advertising agencies.  
In 2021, I entered RS-School courses in order to continue to develop and master the profession of a front-end developer.
